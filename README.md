> *Practicing code walks when it doesn't matter, so skills are sharp when it does.*

Cohort 49, Spring 2021

If you're having trouble following the logic of code samples, because it all still looks like another language, you could probably use some practice. If you feel like you're comfortable reading over code and understanding how it works, then you're probably ready to begin practicing presenting to a group. If you are a great public speaker, you already know that skills must be practiced. 

So there's no good reason you shouldn't take part in this. This group meets twice per week on **Tuesday** and **Thursday** at **6pm Central Time**.

## How It Works

In the file tree, you'll see a directory for code samples and a schedule. An unlimited number of people can present via the study group discord or an arranged zoom conference. Time, however, is limited, so the first person to sign up to present will be given the floor. As their presentation and feedback complete, the next person to have signed up will share their code snippet and walk the group through it. 

Any piece of code is fair game, whether you wrote it yourself or simply found it to be interesting. The goal is to practice reading code to understand what happens without needing to run it first. 

### To volunteer as tribute:

 1. Clone the repo to your IDE and create your own branch.
 2. Add a subdirectory to the `code` directory with your name. This is your cubby.
 3. Organize any code you wish to present within your cubby. You can add additional files as time goes on, and there's no need to remove them after you've presented. 
 4. Add your name and the day you wish to present to the `schedule.txt` file.
 5. Commit the changes, push to the repo and initiate a pull request to merge.
